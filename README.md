# VBA_Challenge

## OVERVIEW 
  Here we would be conduting an analysis of a selected range of stocks using ***VBA***.
  
## PURPOSE
  In this challenge, we will edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that     you did in this module. Then, we will determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written     analysis   that explains your findings.

### BACKGROUND AND CHALLENGES

    Our Basic challenge was as follows :
-   Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents,     he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not         work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

    In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that       you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written       analysis that explains your findings.

    Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by     taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job           because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to         working with the existing code at a job.
    
-   Tasks that we performed
    - Wrote on the provided *VBS* file.
    - Creates "*.xlsm*" from a "*.vbs*" file to create dataset.
    - Opened resources folder containing VBA_Challenge.xlsm, "***VBA_Challenge_2017.PNG, VBA_Challenge_2018.PNG***" to upload on github.
    - Add the VBA_Challenge.vbs script to the Microsoft Visual Basic editor.
    - Refactor VBA code and measure performance to add code where indicated by the numbered comments in the starter code file.    

## Results
  
  In this section we will be able to observe code examples, how the stock trends are in the mentioned years and also the time stamp procedures.
